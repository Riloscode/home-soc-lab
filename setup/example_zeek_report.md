## üìÅ Zeek Log Indicators

### From `conn.log`:
- Multiple **REJ (connection refused)** TCP attempts from 192.168.x.xx targeting 192.168.x.xx on sensitive ports (e.g., `22`, `445`, `3389`, `143`, `110`, `80`, `443`, etc.)
- One **RSTO** connection to port 22 (`TCP Reset by originator`).

### From `weird.log`:

## üõ†Ô∏è Assessment

These behaviors suggest one or more of the following:
- **Misconfigured Apple device** (e.g., AirPlay or remote management enabled).
- **Aggressive scanning or beaconing** behavior by the host.
- Potential **unauthorized activity or compromise**.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

1. **Physically identify** the device (MAC address lookup, DHCP log).
2. **Disable unnecessary services** (AirPlay, SSH, etc.).
3. **Perform endpoint antivirus/malware scan**.
4. **Check firewall rules** and limit outbound access from this host.
5. Continue **Zeek/NIDS monitoring** for any new anomalies or escalation.
