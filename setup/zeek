# ✅ Network Visibility Validation (Zeek)

We verified that Zeek is capturing live network traffic and generating structured logs on the active network interface (`enp0s1`).

---

## 🔎 Test Method

A live capture was initiated using the Zeek container with the following command:

```bash
zeek -i enp0s1 local
Test traffic was then generated using basic commands like:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl http://example.com
ping 8.8.8.8
📁 Logs Captured
Zeek generated the following logs under /pcap and exported them to the mounted host directory ./zeek-logs/:

conn.log – Network connection summaries

dns.log – DNS requests and responses

http.log – HTTP transaction summaries (triggered by curl)

🧠 Sample Log Insight
A parsed summary from conn.log revealed active local devices and external connections:

bash
Copy
Edit
192.168.x.1      # Likely router
192.168.x.20     # Other LAN device
192.168.x.42     # This Zeek VM
Zeek also recorded metadata such as byte counts, ports, protocols, and session durations.

✅ Result
Zeek is fully operational and providing deep network visibility from traffic captured on enp0s1.
Logs are structured, accessible, and reflect real network activity within the lab.
