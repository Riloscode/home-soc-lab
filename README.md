# SOC Lab – Home Security Monitoring Environment

## 📌 Overview
This project documents my hands-on home lab setup for practicing Security Operations Center (SOC) skills using real-world tools like **Security Onion**, **Zeek**, **Nessus**, and **Wireshark**. The goal is to simulate a monitored environment for detecting, analyzing, and responding to suspicious network activity.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Security Onion** – All-in-one SOC platform for intrusion detection and log analysis
- **Zeek (formerly Bro)** – Network traffic analysis
- **Nessus** – Vulnerability scanner
- **Wireshark** – Deep packet inspection
- **VirtualBox/UTM** – Virtualization for isolated lab environments

---

## 📷 Screenshots
Screenshots of the lab setup and alert analysis will be added soon, including:
- Security Onion dashboard
- Zeek log entries
- Detected threats (e.g., DNS tunneling, port scans)

📌 Stay tuned — this section will be updated as I capture and document key moments from the lab.

## ⚙️ Lab Setup
- UTM-based VM running Security Onion
- Bridged NIC to monitor real network traffic
- Logging configured for Zeek, Suricata, and syslog sources
- Nessus scans against local devices for detection practice

---

## 🔎 What I Learned
- Configuring and tuning IDS tools (Zeek, Suricata)
- Identifying suspicious DNS and HTTP traffic
- Detecting port scans and malware signatures
- Interpreting PCAPs and alerts in Security Onion
- Creating actionable detections and reports
