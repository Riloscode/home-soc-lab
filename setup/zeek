# ✅ Network Visibility Validation (Zeek)

We verified that Zeek is capturing live network traffic and generating structured logs on the active network interface (`enp0s1`).

---

## 🔎 Test Method

A live capture was initiated using the Zeek container with the following command:

```bash
zeek -i enp0s1 local
# Test traffic was generated using basic commands like:
curl http://example.com
ping 8.8.8.8
```

## 📁 Logs Captured

Zeek generated the following logs under /pcap and exported them to the mounted host directory ./zeek-logs/:
  conn.log – Network connection summaries
  dns.log – DNS requests and responses
  http.log – HTTP transaction summaries (triggered by curl)

## 🧠 Sample Log Insight
A parsed summary from conn.log revealed active local devices and external connections:
192.168.x.x      # Likely router
192.168.x.xx     # Other LAN devices
192.168.x.xx     # This VM
Zeek also recorded metadata like byte counts, ports, protocols, and durations for each session.

## ✅ Result
Zeek is fully operational and providing deep network visibility from traffic captured on enp0s1. 
Logs are structured, accessible, and show accurate device activity.
